1.Data type difference:
Numeric
- MySQL and SQLServer have INT and NUMERIC(p, s).
- Oracle has NUMBER(p, s).

Character
- All three RDMS have CHAR and VARCHAR.
- Particularly, Oracle has VARCHAR2 synonymous with VARCHAR, but VARCHAR2 is perferred.

2.Syntax perference:
Generally, in MySQL, constraints like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY or UNIQUE are put seperately from attribute definition. But in Oracle or SQLServer, they are usually combined in the definition.

3.DDL difference:
It's the same to CREATE/DROP a table or ALTER ADD/DROP a colomn in 3 RDMS.

To change the data type of a column in a table:
- MySQL 
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype

- Oracle
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  MODIFY column_name datatype
  
- SQLServer
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype
